## Key Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| flutter_riverpod | State management |
| dio | HTTP client |

| hive_flutter | Local storage |
| mobile_scanner | QR code scanning |
| google_mlkit_* | On-device ML (OCR, labeling) |

## Connecting to Server

3. Scan the QR code displayed in the server terminal
4. Start chatting!

Manual connection is also available by entering the server URL directly.

## Architecture

The app follows a feature-first architecture with MVVM pattern and Riverpod for state management:

- **app/** - App-wide configuration (themes, routing, constants)
- **core/** - Shared infrastructure (networking, storage, utilities, services)
- **features/** - Self-contained feature modules organized by business capability
  - Each feature has `data/` (repositories, models), `presentation/` (views, view_models, widgets), and optional `utils/`
  - `presentation/views/` contains screen widgets
  - `presentation/view_models/` contains Riverpod providers for state management
  - `presentation/widgets/` contains feature-specific UI components
- **Services** handle business logic and external communication
- **Storage** manages local persistence with Hive
